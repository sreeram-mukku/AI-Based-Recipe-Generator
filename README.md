# AI-Based-Recipe-Generator
An AI-powered recipe generator that classifies food from an image using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model. The app then fetches a detailed recipe from the Spoonacular API and can translate it on demand. Built with TensorFlow and Keras on the Food-11 dataset to showcase a practical use of transfer learning.
